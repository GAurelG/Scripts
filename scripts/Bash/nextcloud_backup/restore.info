Informations on how to restore the backup don by the other file:)
example command to restore:
sudo duplicity --file-to-restore var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/aurelien/files/Documents/Administration/France/ --no-encryption --archive-dir /media/marmotte1/duplicity/cache/ file:///media/marmotte1/albatros02_backup/ /media/marmotte1/backuptest/

this will restore the directory and files in the backup identified by :var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/aurelien/files/Documents/Administration/France/
in the backup.
These files will be restored taken from the backup in /media/marmotte1/albatros02backup.
The directory and files restored will be in the location: /media/marmotte1/backuptest

I use the sudo because the root files are root owned.
as I am using another `--cache-dir` I need to specify it there.
If I weren't to specify a --file-to-restore I would restore everything that is in the backup.

The restoration is creating the full path found when you look at the `list-current-files`.
It is basically re-creating the full path from the backup starting directory.
In my case I backup from / and exclude lots of things (actually include).
